# Apple Trackpad Proposal
Keyboard shortcut proposal for easy-to-learn, quick, mouse-free access with hands on keyboard under MacOS, Linux Desktops and Windows.

# Appendix: MacOs Trackpad/ Magic Mouse

MacOS users may find much use in [running a trackpad or magic mouse](https://medium.com/@arpitpalod/i-am-so-in-love-with-my-mac-trackpad-c3bbcecef41d) where 1/2/3 Finger swipes and 2 Finger TipTap may be configured via [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) - this rocks but I gave it up in favour of a simple mouse which works on all systems.

General idea:
* 3Finger Swipes and Command-Key-Combinations act on applications, tabs, windows
* 4Finger Swipes and Control-Key-Combinations act on spaces and mission control
* 5Finger Swipes act on mac os system
* left-right movements and arrows switch tabs, windows and spaces
* up/down movements open/close something
* up is fullscreen, down restores size
* 3Finger tap and double tap is reserved for application-specific setup

# TODO

Example configurations and scripts for
* xorg
* mac os BTT
* windows (any chance to get this working?)
